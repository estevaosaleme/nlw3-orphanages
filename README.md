# nlw3-orphanages - Next Level Weekend #3

This repository contains the source files of a Node.js back-end, a React.js front-end, and a React Native mobile app. The applications consist of giving publicity to the orphanages around a city so people can visit them.

The projects are written in TypeScript. With Node.js, the back-end API uses Express.js, multer (for uploading images), TypeORM (Object Relational Mapper), CORS (enabling CORS on Express), and YUP (for validation). In the React.js web application, Axios (for consuming the API) and Leaflet (for maps) are employed. Finally, you will find Expo (to quickly create and deploy apps on iOS and Android) being used.

This was developed along the short yet intensive course Next Level Weekend #3, promoted by RocketSeat.
